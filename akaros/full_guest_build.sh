# Helper script - sets up the tinycore image (setup_tinycore.sh), adds custom
# binaries and config files, builds the CPIO and guest kernel
# (rebuild_cpio_and_linux.sh), and copies the guest to various places.
#
# You need to call this from the directory it is in and pass it a non-relative
# path to a linux repo.  You can set SKIP_KERNEL=1 to avoid rebuilding the guest
# kernel.
#
# You'll want to customize this for your environment.  You'll also want to set
# the PACKAGES variable in setup_tinycore.sh.  This is heavily
# customized for brho's system.
#
# If you don't care about ssh or anything, consider just running
# setup_tinycore.sh, optionally mucking with the contents of tc_root, and then
# rebuild_cpio_and_linux.sh $LINUX_ROOT.
